Linux::TunTap

ABSTRACT
========

This is a module that provides the ability for a Perl script to act as
a network device to receive and transmit raw Ethernet and/or IP
datagrams to the Linux kernel using the tuntap device. With this, you
can build IP tunnels and packet inspecting systems.

This module is almost certainly Linux-specific. (Although since I've
already been asked for a Mac OS X version, this might not remain the
case.)

A pair of scripts to manage the two endpoints of a DNS tunnel are
provided, but they are very, very dirty. This module is merely just
quite dirty (hence the very low version number.)

INSTALLATION
============

b) cd into the directory created
